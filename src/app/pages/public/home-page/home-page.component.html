<h1>Bruno da Silva Jo√£o</h1>

<p>
  Hello. My name Is Bruno and I've been working with Web Developments since
  2010.
</p>
<p>
  I have full knowledge about WEB, UI and UX and I can help your project in many
  ways but the best one is workin on UI, designing and implementing interfaces
  for both mobile and desktop.
</p>
<p>
  My main goal is to create intuitive and accessible interfaces where the user
  can securely do what they need with a minimum effort.
</p>
<p>
  I have had 2 startups and worked in many others as fintechs, 3d modeling, ai,
  biotech, e-commerce, networking, car sharing and social media content
  creation.
</p>
<p>
  I'm a fullstack engineer that has 60%/40% FE/BE experience and I think the sky
  is the limit to what we can do together.
